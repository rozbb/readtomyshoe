                ReadToMyShoe is a website that lets you listen to internet articles and blog posts,
                even when you're offline. ReadToMyShoe is broken up into three sections: the
                "}<strong>{"Library"}</strong>{", the
                "}<strong>{"Queue"}</strong>{", and the
                "}<strong>{"Player"}</strong>{". Here's what each section does:
            "}</p>

                <dd>{"
                    The library tells you which articles you have already saved to ReadToMyShoe.
                    To add a new article to your library, click the
                    "}<a href="#addArticle">{"Add Article"}</a>{"
                    button. You cannot play articles directly from the library. Instead, if you
                    want to listen to an article, you first click the \"+\" button beside the
                    article in the library. This adds it to your queue, where it can be played.
                "}</dd>
                <dt><strong>{ "Queue" }</strong></dt>
                <dd>{"
                    The queue stores all the articles that you want to listen to. These articles
                    are fully downloaded to your device, so you can listen to them even without
                    internet connection. To play an article from the queue, press the \"‚ñ∂Ô∏è\" button
                    next to the article title. The queue will automatically save your place in the
                    article, so you can come back to it later. To delete an article from the queue,
                    press the \"üóë\" button.

                    can play and pause, jump backwards and forwards, and set the playback speed.
                    When you load ReadToMyShoe, the player will already be set to the last article
                    you were reading (if any), so all you need to do is press play.
